"""Execution-feedback helpers for the FDP tutorial.

These wrap the FDP reference target so a Fandango spec can turn *execution
feedback* into an ordinary ``where`` constraint:

    where cover_count(str(<start>)) >= 8            # reward inputs that drive deep
    where reaches(str(<start>), "apply:login")      # demand a specific branch runs
    where response(str(<start>)) == "ERR_NOAUTH"    # constrain on the server's reply
    where covers_new(str(<start>))                  # spread coverage across the pop.

The first three judge each input on its own. ``covers_new`` is different: it
judges an input against everything generated before it, so the *population* as a
whole spreads across the target (see the section further down).

Feedback is *behavioural*: the message is run through the whole
``frame -> parse -> validate -> apply`` pipeline on a fresh session and we read
back what the target did, from the cheap branch trace it records about itself.
No ``sys.settrace`` is involved, so this stays fast inside Fandango's search
loop (line tracing there is orders of magnitude too slow).

# Population coverage feedback: keep only inputs that cover what OTHERS do not.
#
# `cover_count` scores each message in isolation, so the search is happy to fill
# the whole population with inputs that all drive the *same* full accept path.
# A good test suite wants the opposite: every input should pull its weight by
# reaching a branch the rest of the population misses.
#
# `covers_new` turns that into a plain `where` constraint. It keeps a running
# record - in a temporary JSON file, so it survives across the whole fuzzing
# run - of which branches every input seen so far covered, and admits a message
# only if it reaches at least one branch NO other recorded input has:
#
#     covers_new(m) == True   iff m grows the population's covered-branch union
#
# So a redundant input that only retreads covered ground is rejected (punished),
# while an input that reaches a missing branch is accepted (rewarded). An
# accepted input is remembered in the record, so it keeps passing when the
# search re-checks it, while its would-be clones (same branches, nothing new)
# are turned away - the population spreads across branches instead of cloning
# one accept path.
#
# The target has only a handful of single-message branches, so the union fills
# up fast: once every reachable branch has a pioneer no further input can be
# "new", and the suite naturally caps at that minimal covering set (~5-6 here).
# Ask for a few outputs and read it as a `where` constraint:
#
#     where fdp_cover.covers_new(str(<start>))
